# Uncommon HTML Bug: Premature JavaScript Execution

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug where JavaScript execution interferes with the rendering of an HTML element.  The issue arises when a script attempts to modify an element's style before the browser has fully parsed and rendered that element. In some cases, this can lead to the element being completely omitted from the DOM, resulting in its non-appearance on the page.

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe that the div element with the id "myDiv" is not visible.
3. Open `bugSolution.html` for a corrected version.

**Root Cause:**
The core issue lies in the order of execution. The JavaScript code in `bug.html` runs before the browser has fully processed the `<div>` element, causing unpredictable behavior. 

**Solution:**
The solution, as shown in `bugSolution.html`, involves using the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener to ensure the JavaScript executes *after* the HTML is completely parsed and the DOM is ready. This guarantees that the element exists before the script attempts to modify its style.
