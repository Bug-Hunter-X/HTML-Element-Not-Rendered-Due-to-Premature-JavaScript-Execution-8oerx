  <div id="myDiv">
    This text will be hidden if JavaScript is enabled.

  <script>
    document.getElementById("myDiv").style.display = "none";
    // The bug is that this script runs *before* the div is fully parsed.
    // In some browsers this will cause the div to be completely skipped
    // and not rendered at all, even if the script later tried to show it.
